# Project 3 - JavaScript
### Goal
* Design a simple, visually pleasant, JavaScript-based “app” that performs a simple statistical analysis on a small set of numbers.
### Topic
* The program should take three numbers (each entered into a separate text box) and display on the screen: the maximum, minimum, average (arithmetic mean), median, and range.

## Report
* For this project, I used Brackets as my editor. I used the Google Chrome browser to test my page, and when uploading to the server, I used the Edge browser. I validated the HTML5 code for correctness and compliance with the standard using the website, https://validator.w3.org/. The BootStrap template I used is located here: https://colorlib.com/wp/template/login-form-17/.
* Some improvements I made to the app were finding the mode of the three numbers, and if a non-number is entered, the website will alert the user that it cannot be computed.
