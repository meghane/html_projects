# Project 1 - Home Page
### Goal
* Design a simple, visually pleasant, web page on a topic of your choice, using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.
### Topic
* A personal web page that could serve as your online resume.

## Report
* For this project, I used Brackets as my editor. I used the Google Chrome browser to test my page, and when uploading to the server, I used the Edge browser. I validated the HTML5 code for correctness and compliance with the standard using the website, https://validator.w3.org/. The BootStrap template I used is located here: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume.
