Project 3 - JavaScript
Link to my website: lamp.cse.fau.edu/~meghanthomas2022
For this project, I used Brackets as my editor. I used the Google Chrome browser to test
my page, and when uploading to the server, I used the Edge browser. I validated the HTML5 code for correctness and compliance with the standard using the website https://validator.w3.org/. The BootStrap template I used is located here: https://colorlib.com/wp/template/login-form-17/.
The learning curve for JavaScript wasn’t as difficult as I expected it to be. I dabbled in JavaScript a few years back for a school project, so I didn’t begin with a blank slate. I remember preferring Python over it, so I never fully grasped the JavaScript language. The most time-consuming task I encountered was finding a BootStrap template that fit what I needed and didn’t cost anything. I have also noticed that the .css files that come with the BootStrap templates are extremely detailed, and because of this, it takes me a significant amount of time to find colors/fonts/etc.
Some improvements I made to the app were finding the mode of the three numbers, and if a non-number is entered, the website will alert the user that it cannot be computed.
